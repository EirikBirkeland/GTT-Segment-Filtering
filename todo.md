# To do
- [x] Adjust button size and position to fit better with the GTT UI
- [x] Matching source segments should be faded out to a grey text color.
- [ ] Adding a global reset button and/or hotkey(s)
- [ ] Merge into a single button the various "fuzzy" classes: "goog-gtc-from-tm-score-90", "goog-gtc-from-tm-score-99", "goog-gtc-from-tm-score-100-fuzzy"
- [ ] Use MutationObserver to show/hide buttons when a new class comes into existence, or when the last member of a class disappears.
- [ ] It sometimes doesn't choose the best color for a class when a node has several class attributes...
- [ ] goog-gtc-ph-missing should be entirely separate from other tag types in how it's filtered
