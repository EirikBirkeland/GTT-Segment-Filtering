// TODO: (1) Adding a global reset button and/or hotkey(s)
//       (2) Adjust button size and position to fit better with the GTT UI
//       (3) Merge into a single button the various fuzzy classes: "goog-gtc-from-tm-score-90",
//           "goog-gtc-from-tm-score-99", "goog-gtc-from-tm-score-100-fuzzy"
//       (4) Use MutationObserver to show/hide buttons when a new class comes into existence,
//           or when the last member of a class disappears.
//		 (5) It sometimes doesn't choose the best color for a class when a node has several class attributes
//		 (6) goog-gtc-ph-missing should be entirely separate from other tag types in how it's filtered
// TODO: matching source segments should be faded out to a grey text color.
