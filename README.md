# GTT-Segment-Filtering
Filter segment types in GTT

This is a simple Chrome extension which adds the option to show/hide target segment types (ICE/100%/MT/etc.) as you like.

Usage scenario: You have a document that's mostly ICE with only a few translatable segments, but these are scattered across the document, and you could benefit from viewing these translatables in a single view. Simply hide the ICE segments, proofread your translated segments.
